# Monte Carlo Stock Price Simulation  

Simulated multiple potential stock price paths using the Monte Carlo method.  
Each path represents a stochastic process governed by drift and volatility.  

## Key Features
- Modelled geometric Brownian motion.
- Generated 1-year price paths across multiple simulations.
- Analysed expected value, variance, and volatility of returns.

## Tools & Skills
Python | NumPy | matplotlib  

## Output Example
Displays line chart of 10 random simulated price paths over 252 days.
